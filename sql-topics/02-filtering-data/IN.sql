    - You use IN operator in the WHERE clause to check if a value matches any value in a list of values.
    - The IN operator returns true if the value matches any value in the list i.e., value1 , value2, ...
    - The list of values can be a list of literal values such as numbers, strings or a result of a SELECT statement.
