/*
    - PostgreSQL LIKE and ILIKE operators to query data using pattern matchings.
    - You construct a pattern by combining literal values with wildcard characters and use the LIKE or NOT LIKE
        operator to find the matches. PostgreSQL provides you with two wildcards:
            - Percent sign ( %) matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
            - Underscore sign ( _)  matches any single character.
    - The expression returns true if the value matches the pattern.
    - To negate the LIKE operator, you use the NOT operator.
    - If the pattern does not contain any wildcard character, the LIKE operator behaves like the equal.
    - PostgreSQL supports the ILIKE operator that works like the LIKE operator. In addition, the ILIKE operator
        matches value case-insensitively.
