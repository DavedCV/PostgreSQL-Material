/*
    - PostgreSQL LIMIT is an optional clause of the SELECT statement that constrains the number of rows returned
        by the query.
    - In case you want to skip a number of rows before returning the row_count rows, you use OFFSET clause placed
    after the LIMIT clause.
    - Because a table may store rows in an unspecified order, when you use the LIMIT clause, you should always
        use the ORDER BY clause to control the row order. If you donâ€™t use the ORDER BY clause, you may get a
        result set with the unspecified order of rows.
