-- INNER JOIN

/*
    - To join table A with the table B. For each row in the table A, inner join compares the value in the selected
        column with the value in the selected column of every row in the table B: If these values are equal, the inner
        join creates a new row that contains all columns of both tables and adds it to the result set. In case these
        values are not equal, the inner join just ignores them and moves to the next row.
    - When both tables have the same column, you can use the USING syntax.
