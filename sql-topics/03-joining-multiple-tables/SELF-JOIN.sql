-- SELF JOIN
/*
    - A self-join is a regular join that joins a table to itself. In practice, you typically use a self-join to
        query hierarchical data or to compare rows within the same table.
    - To form a self-join, you specify the same table twice with different table aliases and provide the
        join predicate after the ON keyword.
    - A PostgreSQL self-join is a regular join that joins a table to itself using the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN.

-- sample querying hierarchical data:
-- In this employee table, the manager_id column references the employee_id column. The value in the manager_id
-- column shows the manager to whom the employee directly reports. When the value in the manager_id column
-- is null, that employee does not report to anyone. In other words, he or she is the top manager.

CREATE TABLE employee (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
    manager_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employee (employee_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

INSERT INTO employee (
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    manager_id
)
