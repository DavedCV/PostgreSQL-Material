-- EXCEPT

/*
    - Like the UNION and INTERSECT operators, the EXCEPT operator returns rows by comparing the
        result sets of two or more queries.
    - The EXCEPT operator returns distinct rows from the first (left) query that are not in the
        output of the second (right) query.
    - The queries that involve in the EXCEPT need to follow these rules:
        - The number of columns and their orders must be the same in the two queries.
        - The data types of the respective columns must be compatible.
