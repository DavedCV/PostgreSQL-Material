-- UNION

/*
    - The UNION operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.
    - To combine the result sets of two queries using the UNION operator, the queries must conform to the following rules:
        - The number and the order of the columns in the select list of both queries must be the same.
        - The data types must be compatible.
    - The UNION operator removes all duplicate rows from the combined data set. To retain the duplicate rows, you use
        the the UNION ALL instead.
    - To sort rows in the final result set, you use the ORDER BY clause in the second query.
