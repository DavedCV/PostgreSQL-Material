-- GROUPING SETS

/*
    - A grouping set is a set of columns by which you group by using the GROUP BY clause.
    - Suppose that you want to get different grouping sets from a  table by using a single query. To achieve
        this, you may use the UNION ALL to combine all the queries. Even though this works as you
        expected, it has two main problems: First, it is quite lengthy, Second, it has a performance issue
        because PostgreSQL has to scan the table separately for each query.
    - To make it more efficient, PostgreSQL provides the GROUPING SETS clause which is the
        subclause of the GROUP BY clause.
    - The GROUPING SETS allows you to define multiple grouping sets in the same query.
*/

-- GROUPING FUNCTION

/*
    - The GROUPING() function accepts an argument which can be a column name or an expression.
    - The column_name or expression must match with the one specified in the GROUP BY clause.
    - The GROUPING() function returns bit 0 if the argument is a member of the current grouping set and 1 otherwise.
