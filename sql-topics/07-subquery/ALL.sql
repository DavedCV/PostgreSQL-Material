-- ALL

/*
    - The PostgreSQL ALL operator allows you to query data by comparing a value with a list of values returned by a subquery.
    - The ALL operator must be preceded by a comparison operator such as equal (=), not equal (!=), greater than (>),
        greater than or equal to (>=), less than (<), and less than or equal to (<=).
    - The ALL operator must be followed by a subquery which also must be surrounded by the parentheses.
    - In case the subquery returns no row, then the ALL operator always evaluates to true.
