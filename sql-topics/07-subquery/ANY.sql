-- ANY

/*
    - The PostgreSQL ANY operator compares a value to a set of values returned by a subquery.
    - The subquery must return exactly one column.
    - The ANY operator must be preceded by one of the following comparison operator =, <=, >, <, > and <>
    - The ANY operator returns true if any value of the subquery meets the condition, otherwise, it returns false.
    - The = ANY is equivalent to IN operator.
