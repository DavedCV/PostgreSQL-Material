-- COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS

/*
    - A common table expression is a temporary result set which you can reference within another SQL statement
        including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE.
    - Common Table Expressions are temporary in the sense that they only exist during the execution of the query.
    - Common Table Expressions or CTEs are typically used to simplify complex joins and subqueries in PostgreSQL.

    STRUCTURE:
    - First, specify the name of the CTE following by an optional column list.
    - Second, inside the body of the WITH clause, specify a query that returns a result set. If you do not explicitly
        specify the column list after the CTE name, the select list of the CTE_query_definition will become the column
        list of the CTE.
    - Third, use the CTE like a table or view in the statement which can be a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
