    -- CREATE TABLE AS

    - The CREATE TABLE AS statement creates a new table and fills it with the data returned by a query.

    - The columns of the new table will have the names and data types associated with the output columns of the SELECT
        clause. If you want the table columns to have different names, you can specify the new table columns after the new
        table name

    - In case you want to avoid an error by creating a new table that already exists, you can use the IF NOT EXISTS.

    - Note that the CREATE TABLE AS statement is similar to the SELECT INTO statement, but the CREATE TABLE AS statement
        is preferred
