    -- NUMERIC TYPE

    - The NUMERIC type can store numbers with a lot of digits. Typically, you use the NUMERIC type for numbers that
        require exactness such as monetary amounts or quantities.

    NUMERIC(precision, scale)

    - In this syntax, the precision is the total number of digits and the scale is the number of digits in the fraction
        part. For example, the number 1234.567 has the precision 7 and scale 3.
    - The NUMERIC type can hold a value up to 131,072 digits before the decimal point 16,383 digits after the decimal point.
    - If you omit both precision and scale, you can store any precision and scale up to the limit of the precision and
        scale mentioned above.
    - If precision is not required, you should not use the NUMERIC type because calculations on NUMERIC values are
        typically slower than integers, floats, and double precisions.
    - If you store a value with a scale greater than the declared scale of the NUMERIC column, PostgreSQL will round
        the value to a specified number of fractional digits.
    - In addition to holding numeric values, the NUMERIC type can also hold a special value called NaN which stands for
        not-a-number.
