-- FULL OUTER JOIN

/*
    - The full outer join combines the results of both the left join and the right join.
    - If the rows in the joined table do not match, the full outer join sets NULL values for every column of the
        table that does not have the matching row.
    - If a row from one table matches a row in another table, the result row will contain columns populated
        from columns of rows from both tables.
