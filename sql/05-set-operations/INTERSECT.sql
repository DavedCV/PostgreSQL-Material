-- INTERSECT

/*
    - Like the UNION operator, the PostgreSQL INTERSECT operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements
        into a single result set.
    - The INTERSECT operator returns any rows that are available in both result sets.
    - To use the INTERSECT operator, the columns that appear in the SELECT statements must follow the folowing rules:
        - The number of columns and their order in the SELECT clauses must be the same.
        - The data types of the columns must be compatible.
    - If you want to sort the result set returned by the INTERSECT operator, you place the ORDER BY at the final
        query in the query list
