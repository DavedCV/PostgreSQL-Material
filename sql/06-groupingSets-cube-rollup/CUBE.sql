-- CUBE

/*
    - PostgreSQL CUBE is a subclause of the GROUP BY clause. The CUBE allows you to generate multiple grouping sets.
    - The query generates all possible grouping sets based on the dimension columns specified in CUBE.
    - In general, if the number of columns specified in the CUBE is n, then you will    have 2^n combinations.

CREATE TABLE sales (
    brand VARCHAR NOT NULL,

FROM

GROUP BY
