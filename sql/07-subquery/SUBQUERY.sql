-- SUBQUERY

/*
    - A subquery is a query nested inside another query such as SELECT, INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE. In this
        tutorial, we are focusing on the SELECT statement only.
    - To construct a subquery, we put the second query in brackets and use it in the WHERE clause as an expression.
    - The query inside the brackets is called a subquery or an inner query. The query that contains the subquery
        is known as an outer query.
    - PostgreSQL executes the query that contains a subquery in the following sequence:
        - First, executes the subquery.
        - Second, gets the result and passes it to the outer query.
        - Third, executes the outer query.
