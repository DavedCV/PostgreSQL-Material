    -- JSON

    - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is an open standard format that consists of key-value pairs.

    - PostgreSQL supports native JSON data type since version 9.2. It provides many functions and operators for
        manipulating JSON data.

    - PostgreSQL provides two native operators -> and ->> to help you query JSON data.
        - The operator -> returns JSON object field by key.
        - The operator ->> returns JSON object field by text.
