    -- TIME DATA TYPE

    - PostgreSQL provides the TIME data type that allows you to store the time of day values.

    column_name TIME(precision);

    - A time value may have a precision up to 6 digits. The precision specifies the number of fractional digits placed in
        the second field.

    - The TIME data type requires 8 bytes and its allowed range is from 00:00:00 to 24:00:00. The following illustrates
        the common formats of the TIME values:
        - HH:MI
        - HH:MI:SS
        - HHMISS

    - Besides the TIME data type, PostgreSQL provides the TIME with time zone data type that allows you to store and
        manipulate the time of day with time zone.
    - PostgreSQL allows you to apply arithmetic operators such as +, -,  and *  on time values and between time and
        interval values.
